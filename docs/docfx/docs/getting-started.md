# Getting Started

## Adding the NuGet package to your project
You need to pull BP.AdventureFramework into your project. The easiest way to do this is to add the NuGet package. The latest package and installation instructions are available [here](https://github.com/benpollarduk/BP.AdventureFramework/pkgs/nuget/BP.AdventureFramework).

## First Game
Once the package has been installed it's time to jump in and start building your first game.

### Setup
To start with create a new Console application. Regardless of target framework, it should look something like this:

```csharp
namespace BP.AdventureFramework.GettingStarted
{
    internal class Program
    {
        private static void Main(string[] args)
        {
           
        }
    }
}
```

### Adding a PlayableCharacter
Every game requires a character to play as, lets add that next:

```csharp
private static PlayableCharacter CreatePlayer()
{
    return new PlayableCharacter("Dave", "A young boy on a quest to find the meaning of life.");
}
```

In this example whenever **CreatePlayer** is called a new **PlayableCharacter** will be created. The character is called "Dave" and has a description that describes him as "A young boy on a quest to find the meaning of life.".

### Creating the game world
The game world consists of a hierarchy of three tiers: **Overworld**, **Region** and **Room**. We will create a simple **Region** with two **Rooms**. We can do this directly in the **Main** function for simplicity. To start with lets make the **Rooms**:

```csharp
private static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var cavern = new Room("Cavern", "A dark cavern set in to the base of the mountain.", new Exit(Direction.North));

    var tunnel = new Room("Tunnel", "A dark tunnel leading inside the mountain.", new Exit(Direction.South));
}
```

Although the **Rooms** haven't been added to a **Region** yet there are exits in place that will allow the player to move between them.

Games are boring without **Items** to interact with, let's add an item to the tunnel:

```csharp
var holyGrail = new Item("Holy Grail", "A dull golden cup, looks pretty old.", true);

tunnel.AddItem(holyGrail);
```

Looking good, but the **Rooms** need to be contained within a **Region**. **RegionMaker** simplifies this process, but sometimes creating a **Region** directly may be more appropriate if more control is needed. Here we will use **RegionMaker**:

```csharp
var regionMaker = new RegionMaker("Mountain", "An imposing volcano just East of town.")
{
    [0, 0, 0] = cavern,
    [0, 1, 0] = tunnel
};
```

This needs more breaking down. The **RegionMaker** will create a region called "Mountain" with a description of "An imposing volcano just East of town.". The region will contain two rooms, the cavern and the tunnel. The cavern will be added at position *x* 0, *y* 0, *z* 0. The tunnel will be added at position *x* 0, *y* 1, *z* 0, north of the cavern.

The game world is nearly complete, but the **Region** needs to exist within an **Overworld** for it to be finished. We will use **OverworldMaker** to achieve this:

```csharp
var overworldMaker = new OverworldMaker("Daves World", "An ancient kingdom.", regionMaker);
```

This will create an **Overworld** called "Daves World" which is described as "An ancient kingdom" and contains a single **Region**.

All together the code looks like this:

```csharp
var cavern = new Room("Cavern", "A dark cavern set in to the base of the mountain.", new Exit(Direction.North));

var tunnel = new Room("Tunnel", "A dark tunnel leading inside the mountain.", new Exit(Direction.South));

var holyGrail = new Item("Holy Grail", "A dull golden cup, looks pretty old.", true);

tunnel.AddItem(holyGrail);

var regionMaker = new RegionMaker("Mountain", "An imposing volcano just East of town.")
{
    [0, 0, 0] = cavern,
    [0, 1, 0] = tunnel
};

var overworldMaker = new OverworldMaker("Daves World", "An ancient kingdom.", regionMaker);
```

### Checking if the game is complete
For a game to come to an end it needs to reach either a game over state or a completion state.

Firstly lets look at the logic that determines if the game is complete. An **EndCheck** is required, which returns an **EndCheckResult** that determines if the game is complete.

In this example lets make a method that determines if the game is complete. The game is complete if the player has the holy grail:

```csharp
private static EndCheckResult IsGameComplete(Game game)
{
    if (!game.Player.FindItem("Holy Grail", out _))
        return EndCheckResult.NotEnded;

    return new EndCheckResult(true, "Game Complete", "You have the Holy Grail!");
}
```

If the player has the holy grail then the **EndCheckResult** will return that the game has ended, and have a title that will read "Game Complete" and a description that reads "You have the Holy Grail!".

A common game over state may be if the player dies:

```csharp
private static EndCheckResult IsGameOver(Game game)
{
    if (game.Player.IsAlive)
        return EndCheckResult.NotEnded;

    return new EndCheckResult(true, "Game Over", "You died!");
}
```

### Creating the game
The game now has all the required assets and logic it just needs some boilerplate to tie everything together before it is ready to play.

A **GameCreationCallback** is required to instantiate an instance of a **Game**. This is so that new instances of the **Game** can be created as required.

```csharp
var gameCreator = Game.Create(
    "The Life Of Dave",
    "Dave awakes to find himself in a cavern...",
    "A very low budget adventure.",
    overworldMaker.Make,
    CreatePlayer,
    IsGameComplete,
    IsGameOver);
```

This requires some breaking down. The **Game** class has a **Create** method that can be used to create instances of **Game**. This takes the following arguments:
* **Name** - the name of the game.
* **Introduction** - an introduction to the game.
* **Description** - a description of the game.
* **OverworldGenerator** - a callback for generating instances of the overworld.
* **PlayerGenerator** - a callback for generating instances of the player.
* **CompletionCondition** - a callback for determining if the game is complete.
* **GameOverCondition** - a callback for determining if the game is over.

### Executing the game
The game is executed simply by calling the static **Execute** method on **Game** and passing in the game creation callback.

```csharp
Game.Execute(gameCreator);
```

### Bringing it all together
The full example code should look like this:

```csharp
using BP.AdventureFramework.Assets;
using BP.AdventureFramework.Assets.Characters;
using BP.AdventureFramework.Assets.Locations;
using BP.AdventureFramework.Logic;
using BP.AdventureFramework.Utilities;

namespace BP.AdventureFramework.GettingStarted
{
    internal class Program
    {
        private static EndCheckResult IsGameComplete(Game game)
        {
            if (!game.Player.FindItem("Holy Grail", out _))
                return EndCheckResult.NotEnded;

            return new EndCheckResult(true, "Game Complete", "You have the Holy Grail!");
        }

        private static EndCheckResult IsGameOver(Game game)
        {
            if (game.Player.IsAlive)
                return EndCheckResult.NotEnded;

            return new EndCheckResult(true, "Game Over", "You died!");
        }

        private static PlayableCharacter CreatePlayer()
        {
            return new PlayableCharacter("Dave", "A young boy on a quest to find the meaning of life.");
        }

        private static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var cavern = new Room("Cavern", "A dark cavern set in to the base of the mountain.", new Exit(Direction.North));

            var tunnel = new Room("Tunnel", "A dark tunnel leading inside the mountain.", new Exit(Direction.South));

            var holyGrail = new Item("Holy Grail", "A dull golden cup, looks pretty old.", true);

            tunnel.AddItem(holyGrail);

            var regionMaker = new RegionMaker("Mountain", "An imposing volcano just East of town.")
            {
                [0, 0, 0] = cavern,
                [0, 1, 0] = tunnel
            };

            var overworldMaker = new OverworldMaker("Daves World", "An ancient kingdom.", regionMaker);

            var gameCreator = Game.Create(
                "The Life Of Dave",
                "Dave awakes to find himself in a cavern...",
                "A very low budget adventure.",
                overworldMaker.Make,
                CreatePlayer,
                IsGameComplete,
                IsGameOver);

            Game.Execute(gameCreator);
        }
    }
}
```

Simply build and run the application and congratulations, you have a working BP.AdventureFramework game!
